## Project Status

This project is currently in its **initial development phase**. The structure and core functionality are in place, but some features, such as **Tailwind CSS integration**, are not fully implemented or functional. This repository serves as a starting point for further development and improvement.

### What's Working:
- Basic project structure and routing.
- Core backend functionality is not yet fully integrated and remains untested. (e.g., file upload, document recommendations).
- Placeholder frontend components.

### What Needs Improvement:
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Tailwind CSS is partially set up but not fully functional. Styles may not render correctly, and further configuration is required.
- Frontend-backend alignment: Some API endpoints need to be properly connected to the frontend.
- Additional features: Enhancements like user authentication, advanced search, and responsive design are yet to be implemented.
